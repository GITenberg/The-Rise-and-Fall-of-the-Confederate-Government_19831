description: "The Rise and Fall of the Confederate Government (1881) is a book written\
  \ by Jefferson Davis, who served as President of the Confederate States of America\
  \ during the American Civil War. Davis wrote the book as a straightforward history\
  \ of the Confederate States of America and as an apologia for the causes that he\
  \ believed led to and justified the American Civil War.\nHe wrote most of the book\
  \ at Beauvoir, the Biloxi, Mississippi plantation where he was living as a guest\
  \ of the novelist and wealthy widow Sarah Ellis Dorsey. Ill with cancer, in 1878\
  \ she made over her will and left the plantation to him before her death in 1879.\
  \ She had already assisted him in his writing, notably with organization, editing\
  \ and encouragement.\nDavis was also assisted by his wife, Varina, and his secretary\
  \ Major W.T. Walthall. He corresponded voluminously with surviving Confederate statesmen\
  \ and generals, including Judah Benjamin and Jubal Early, for fact checking and\
  \ details on key issues.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
